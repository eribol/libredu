Libredu is free, online and open source generating timetables schedules for schools.
- It is easy to use but under development(somethings could change).
- Developed with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [MoonZoon](https://github.com/MoonZoon/MoonZoon)
- No a lot of features like alternatives. No colors, no options.

If you want to create a desktop app for it, you can look at page/school/group/generate.rs file. 
Libredu uses webassembly(thanks to rust wasm and seed). And it is realy fast but still, will increase the speed. But desktop apps will be more faster.

For now, i think using libredu for big schools or universities not a good idea. But still, if you want to use it, you can send feedback for your needs.
